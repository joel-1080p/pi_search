Pi Search lets you search pi for any kind of search tearm.
This could be your name, town, or any word that's not too long.

## RUNNING PI SEARCH
- Downoad Pi Numbers from [here](https://pi2e.ch/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pi_dec_1m.txt) (It was too large for Github)
- Move this txt file in to the same direcotry as `pi_search.py`.
  
## HOW IT WORKS
- `pi_search.py` maps the alphabet to T9 style (same as your old texting phone).
- It returns the location of the term as a JSON file.

## HOW I USE IT
- I use it in my portfolio website as part of the react/flask backend. [Website](http://38.125.229.163:3000/pi-search)

## Requirements

-   [Python](https://www.python.org) \>= 2.7, 3.4+
-   [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) \>= 3.0.3

### P.S.

Please drop me a note with any feedback you have.
